      The first sets the stage for the adventure and follows<strong>
        Frodo Baggins</strong
      >
      as he flees from his home in the Shire to escape the minions of the
      <strong>Dark Lord Sauron</strong>. Sauron seeks the One Ring that will
      allow him to control the Bearers of the nineteen other Rings and control
      the three major races of Middle-earth: Elves, Men, and Dwarves. The One
      Ring has been inherited by Frodo who finds himself unwittingly in the
      midst of a struggle for world domination.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first chapter in the book begins quite lightly, following on from The
      Hobbit which is more of a whimsical children's story than The Lord of the
      Rings. It begins with Bilbo celebrating his 111th (or eleventy first, as
      it is called) birthday, on the same day that Frodo celebrates his 33rd
      birthday (his 'coming of age'). At the birthday party, Bilbo disappears
      after his speech, to the surprise of all.<em> Frodo </em> later learns
      about the ring which he had used to make himself invisible, and also about
      some of its darker powers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Heeding the advice of the wizard<strong> Gandalf </strong>, Frodo leaves
      his home, taking the Ring with him. He hopes to reach Rivendell, where he
      will be safe from Sauron, and where those wiser than he can decide what to
      do about the Ring.
    </p>

    <p>
      In his journey he is accompanied by three hobbit friends, Peregrin Took,
      Meriadoc Brandybuck and <strong> Samwise Gamgee </strong>, often refered
      to as Merry, Pippin and Sam. From the start they are pursued by Black
      Riders, the Ringwraiths who serve Sauron. Narrowly escaping these and
      other dangers and meeting other interesting characters en route (e.g., Tom
      Bombadil) they eventually come to Bree, where they meet Strider, another
      friend of Gandalf who leads them the rest of the way to Rivendell, through
      further hardships.
    </p>

    <p>
      Frodo is stabbed upon the mountain of Weathertop by the chief of the
      Nazgûl with a Morgul-knife - as part of the knife stays inside him, he
      gets sicker on the rest of the journey. They also pass the trolls which
      had been turned to stone in the previous book, The Hobbit.
    </p>

    <h3>Chapters:</h3>

        leaving the Shire.
      </dd>
      <dt>II: The Shadow of the Past:</dt>
      <dd>
        Gandalf tells Frodo the true nature of the ring, and how it must be

        window, is told to accompany Frodo.
      </dd>
      <dt>III: Three is Company:</dt>
      <dd>
        Frodo sells Bag End, and officially is going to move to a house at
        Crickhollow in the area beyond Bucklebury in Buckland; he actually plans
        to disappear without causing too much of a fuss. Frodo, Sam and Pippin
        set out through the South Farthing of the Shire towards Buckland, and
        encounter a black rider. They also meet Gildor the wood elf, with other
        wood elves.
      </dd>
      <dt>IV: A Short Cut to Mushrooms:</dt>
      <dd>
        They meet Farmer Maggot while taking a short cut, and he gives them some
        of his prized mushrooms. Merry joins them at the end.
      </dd>
      <dt>V: A Conspiracy Unmasked:</dt>
      <dd>
        Takes place at Frodo's new house at Crickhollow. The title refers to
        Frodo about to tell Merry and Pippin about his quest, who he had
        previously believed not to know about it, and they tell him that they
        had known much of it all along. They also meet Fatty Bolger. Frodo
        decides to leave the next day through the Old Forest, as it is an
        unexpected direction, rather than travelling on the roads.
      </dd>
      <dt>VI: The Old Forest:</dt>
      <dd>
        Although trying to avoid it, the hobbits get lost and travel to the

        Pippin are trapped inside Old Man Willow, and are freed only when Tom
        Bombadil arrives.
      </dd>
      <dt>VII: In the House of Tom Bombadil:</dt>
      <dd>
        Tom knows much about the hobbits, and even tries on the Ring, yet it
        does not have any effect on him - it doesn't even make him invisible.
        Frodo tries on the ring then to see if it 'works', and Tom Bombadil is
        also able to see Frodo while he has the ring on.
      </dd>
      <dt>VIII: Fog on the Barrow-downs:</dt>
      <dd>
        Travelling through the Barrow-downs, the hobbits are imprisoned by

      </dd>
      <dt>IX: At the Sign of the Prancing Pony:</dt>
      <dd>
        The hobbits reach the The Prancing Pony inn at Bree, where Frodo uses a
        false name, Underhill. Later, after singing a song on a table, he trips
        and accidentally puts the ring on his finger, disappearing, which causes
        a commotion.
      </dd>
      <dt>X: Strider:</dt>
      <dd>
        Strider, who had at first seemed menacing, turns out to be friendly. The
        innkeeper, Butterbur, gives Frodo a late letter from Gandalf, which
        tells him that Strider is a friend of Gandalf's whose real name is
        Aragorn.
      </dd>
      <dt>XI: A Knife in the Dark:</dt>
      <dd>
        The hobbits set out from Bree with Strider on foot after their horses
        had bolted when Black Riders arrived at the inn at night. The Riders had
        attacked the beds which they were supposed to be staying in, though in
        vain as Strider had them stay in another room. They buy a pony from Bill
        Ferny. They pass through the Midgewater Marshes, and reach Weathertop.
        There they are attacked by five Black Riders; Frodo puts on the ring to
        escape them, and is stabbed in the shoulder by the Witch-king of Angmar,
        leader of the nine Ringwraiths (Nazgul).
      </dd>
      <dt>XII: Flight to the Ford:</dt>
      <dd>
        They pass the trolls Bert, Tom and William, which were turned to stone
        by Gandalf in The Hobbit. Eventually, they meet the elf Glorfindel from
        Rivendell, who allows Frodo to take his white horse to escape the
        Ringwraiths on their way to Rivendell. The Black Riders are washed away
        in a flood over the Ford.

      Book II: The Journey of the Nine Companions / The Ring Goes South
    </h1>

    <h2>
      Alan Lee's 1998 cover for The Fellowship of the Ring by J.R.R. Tolkien
    </h2>

    <p>
      Book II chronicles Frodo's stay at Rivendell, where a plan is hatched at
      the Council of Elrond to destroy the Ring in Mordor. Early on Frodo meets
      his uncle Bilbo, whom he had not seen since he left Hobbiton much earlier.
      Frodo sets forth from Rivendell with nine companions:<em>
        two Men, Aragorn and Boromir, son of the Steward of the land of Gondor;
        an Elven prince, Legolas; Frodo's old friend and powerful wizard,
        Gandalf; Gimli the Dwarf; and Frodo's original three hobbit
        companions</em
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>These Nine Walkers</strong> were chosen to represent the free
      races of Middle-earth and as a balance to the Nine Riders. They were also
      accompanied by Bill the Pony, whom Strider and the Hobbits acquired in
      Bree as a pack horse. Their attempt to cross the Misty Mountains is foiled
      by heavy snow, so they are forced to take a path under the mountains via
      Moria, an ancient Dwarf kingdom, now full of Orcs and other evil
      creatures, such as the Watcher in the Water guarding the south gate. Just
      before escaping Moria, Gandalf falls into the abyss while battling a
      Balrog.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>The remaining eight members of the Fellowship</em> then spend some
      time in the elf-haven of Lothlórien, where they receive gifts from the
      Elf-queen Galadriel that in many cases prove useful later in the quest.
      They leave Lórien by river, but Frodo begins to realize the Ring is having
      a malevolent effect on some members of the party, especially Boromir, who
      tries to take the ring from Frodo. In the process, Frodo puts on the ring
      to escape him. Later Boromir is attacked by orcs while trying to defend
      Merry and Pippin. This book ends when Frodo and Sam depart secretly for
      Mordor and the Fellowship of the Ring dissolves.
