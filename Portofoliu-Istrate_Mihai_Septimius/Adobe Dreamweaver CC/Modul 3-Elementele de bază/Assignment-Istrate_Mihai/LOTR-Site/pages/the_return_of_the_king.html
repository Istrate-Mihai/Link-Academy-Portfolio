	<h1 id="fifthbook">Book V: The War of the Ring</h1>
		
	<p>The story begins as<strong> Gandalf</strong> delivers news to<strong> Denethor</strong>, the steward of Gondor, that war is imminent. Gandalf brings Pippin with him, who enters the service of the steward. Aragorn, by his courage and leadership, proves himself a worthy ruler of men. He is destined to find a lost army of men now dead yet entrapped in a curse set forth long ago by their own disobedience, in the place known as the Paths of the Dead.</p>
		<p>The remnants of the Fellowship lead the forces of Gondor and Rohan in defence of Gondor's capital city, Minas Tirith, resulting in the cataclysmic Battle of the <em>Pelennor Fields</em>. Those characters who manage to survive the battle are led by Aragorn on an assuredly suicidal feint-attack against the Black Gates of Mordor, partly to distract Sauron from defending his other borders so that Frodo and Sam can gain a clear passage into Mordor. Aragorn's company now surrounds the Black Gates of the Morannon exchanging idle words with the Mouth of Sauron.

		<p>In the meanwhile, the brave and loyal Sam Gamgee (who for a short time had himself become the ring-bearer) enables the <strong>long-suffering Frodo Baggins</strong> to navigate the barren wasteland of Mordor. For part of the way, they are captured by a company of Orcs and must pretend to be orcs before they are able to escape.</p>
		<p>The company, tired and half-alive, finally reaches the Crack of Doom, where the One Ring is destroyed along with Gollum, freeing Middle-earth from Sauron's power forever. This happens when Frodo at the last moment decides to keep the ring rather than destroy it, and is attacked by <strong>Gollum</strong> who bites off Frodo's finger to take the ring, trips, and falls into the lava while still holding the ring. Frodo and Sam are rescued by the giant eagles whom Gandalf rides to Mount Doom, from the black gates of Morannon.</p>
		<p>After Sauron is defeated, his armies at the black gates flee, and the men of Gondor and Rohan are victorious in the battle.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Aragorn is crowned King of Gondor</strong> at Minas Tirith. After a series of goodbyes, the Hobbits return home, only to find the Shire under the control of 'Sharkey' who they find out is Saruman, diminished in power but not in malevolence. Merry and Pippin, now experienced warriors of Rohan and Gondor respectively, take the lead in setting things right again, and lead an uprising of hobbits against Saruman, freeing the shire. Time passes.</p>
		<p>The Shire heals, but Frodo does not. Eventually Frodo departs for the Undying Lands to find healing, along with Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf and the Elves. Sam, Merry and Pippin watch them depart and return home in silence. Sam is greeted by his wife Rose and his daughter Elanor. In the last line of the book Sam says to Rose; "Well, I'm back".</p>
